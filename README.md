# learningNode

NodeJs is written in javaScript which makes the transition to Node take less time if you are already familiar with javaScript. In this repo we are going to learn about this framework and practice, dealing with backend and databases.

Let's take a look at the nature of Node.js and some of the benefits associated with Node.js:

1. Node is popular: Node.js is one of the most popular platforms for application development as it uses Javascript. Javascript
   is a powerful programming language as it provides good flexibility to developers.

2. Full-Stack JavaScript development: Node.js has paved the way for JavaScript to be on the server side. hence applications can now have both back-ned and front-end developed with the same JavaScript language. We now have two popular JavaScript software stacks for building full-stack web applications: MEAN and MERN

MEAN => MongoDB, Express, Angular and Node
MERN => MongoDB, Express, React and Node

3. Very Fast: Node applications have better performance than applications developed using other technologies due to the internal JavaScript engine in Node. The engine converts JavaScript code into machine code and provides high-speed execution.

4. Node is powerful: Node uses a non-blocking I/O model and asynchronous programming paradigm, which helps in processing requests in a non-blocking way.

5. Data Streaming: Node has a built-in Streams API that helps create applications where data streaming is required.

6. Rich Ecosystem: Node.js provides a package manager call NPM(node package manager), the world's largest software registry that helps open-source developers to share and use packages using NPM.

7. Modularity: Node applications can be developed as modules which helps in dividing the application inot a reusable set of code.

8. Wide client-side and database connectivity: Node.js has no dependencies and goes perfectly with any possible client-side
   technologies like Angular, React, etc. and any database like MySQL or MongoDB

## What is Node.js?

Node.js is an open-source JavaScript run-time environment used for building scalable network applications. It helps in developing the server-side of the applicaton using JavaScript language. It is used for building data-intesive real-time applications.

## What can we build using Node.js?

1. Complex SPA(Single Page Applications)
2. Real-time applications like Chat Rooms
   Data streaming applications
3. REST APIs
4. Server-side web applications
