What is Node.js?

NodeJs is written in javaScript which makes the transition to Node take less time if you are already familiar with javaScript. In this repo we are going to learn about this framework and practice, dealing with backend and databases.

Node.js is an execution environment that runs on top of the V8 JavaScript engine. Its base premise is that it is asynchronous and event-driven. This means that all the blocking operations, such as reading data from a file, can be handled in the background while the other parts of the application continue to do their work. When the data has finished loading, an event is emitted and whoever was waiting for the data can now execute and do the work.
